   <h2>Good Ending</h2>
   <p>If the players choose to escape via the other<br>
    route, the player will enter a cave with a platform<br> 
    held by chains above lava in the centre of the cave. <br>
    The monster is standing on that platform. Players <br>
    learn through a vision about a machine that turned the<br> 
    entire world grey and filled with his minions terrorizing<br>
    locals. To restore the world, players must defeat the <br>
    monster. The monster’s death reverses the machine’s effect.<br> 
    Players then return back to the daycare where they meet with <br>
    Sarah, who shares her experience during the time she had <br>
    disappeared. As she turns around to lead players inside the <br>
    daycare once again... something’s not quite right with her... <br>
