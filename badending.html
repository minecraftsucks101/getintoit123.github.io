   <h2>Bad Ending</h2>
   <p>If the players choose to cross the bridge, a giant <br>
       version of the scary monster will rise from the <br>
       water, appearing incredibly aggressive. The monster <br>
       will begin to blow strong wind towards the bridge, <br>
       knocking off the logs and player into the water. <br>
       The river will carry the player down into a secret <br>
       base where they will find Sarah stuck in a tube. </p>
