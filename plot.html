   <h2>Plot</h2>
   <p>First, you are greeted at the daycare by Sarah, the caretaker. <br> 
    Players are then allowed time to explore the daycare’s layout and rooms downstairs. <br>
    After some time passes, Sarah encourages players to participate in a soccer game, where players can choose between being in the RED or BLUE team. <br>
    Players are then given 60 seconds to play a match, and score for their team. Once the match is over, players can make their way into the cafeteria to choose from a selection of foods. <br>
    After dinner, players will be redirected to the TV screen where it shows accounts of a monster in a daycare. <br>
    Suddenly, the lights will turn off and several monsters will attack the players. <br>
    Players are encouraged to run or hide. Once the power has come back on, players try to alert Sarah of the monster that appeared, however she does not believe you and players are then told to go to bed. <br>

    The next morning, players can head down to the cafeteria to eat pancakes for breakfast and being given playtime afterwards. <br>
    Players then move to the lounge room where everyone discusses the events that took place last night with the monsters. <br>
    Sarah then tells them that the monster is not real, until the monsters outside interrupt her. <br>
    Sarah then realizes that the monsters are real and calls players into the elevator. <br>
    The main monster appears inside the daycare, using his powers to send the elevator deep down.<br>
    <br>
    Players find themselves within a dark hallway, but zero signs of Sarah. <br>
    Players must hop onto a minecart and complete an obby. <br>
    Afterwards, players find themselves outside of the cave and inside a dark forest. <br>
    There will be sudden rain, causing players to lose health. <br>
    Once the rain stops, players have to use an axe to knock down trees and collect logs in order to make a campfire and keep warm. <br>
    Sitting at the campfire will increase a player’s health, but there will be a sudden zap of lightning, causing the campfire to explode. <br>
    Once the rain has cleared, monster-like wolf with horns will appear and players must attack the wolf with axes and avoid becoming the wolf’s next dinner. <br>
    Once it is morning, players must continue on following the path to find Sarah and get back to the daycare. <br>
    The single path splits off into two directions and players will come across a not very. <br>
    This is where players must decide between crossing the bridge or choosing the alternative pathway to escape. <br>
    The player’s decision will affect which ending they will receive.</p>
